====================
       MixVis
====================


ABOUT
====================
A standalone mixing visualizer. Let me know if you have suggestions for a better name please. 
Recieves audio in via JACK server and displays it.

Currently only working on Linux.


PREREQUISITES
====================
- JACK Audio Connection Kit (http://jackaudio.org/)
- FFTW3 fft libraries (http://www.fftw.org/)


INSTALLATION
====================
1. Pull down the code from repository
2. Go into the Builds/Linux directory and run make
3. The executable MixVis should now be in Builds/Linux/build


USING THE VISUALIZER
====================
1. Make sure jack server is running and is in realtime mode ("jackd -R -dalsa" is what I have been
using)
2. Start up the visualizer (./Builds/Linux/build/Mixvis). It is important to do this BEFORE starting
any other applications that use JACK because the visualizer is not yet smart about which JACK device
it connects to (it chooses the last one that it finds currently running on the system)
3. Start up your third party audio application. You must do this AFTER starting the visualizer (see
previous step for explanation)
4. Make the appropriate connections via the Jack Audio Connection Kit patchbay. The outputs from your
third party application should be routed to the inputs on the device "MixVisJACK".
5. Now it should work!

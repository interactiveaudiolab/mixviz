====================
       MixVis
====================


ABOUT
====================
A standalone mixing visualizer. Let me know if you have suggestions for a better name please. 
Recieves audio in via Jack server and displays it.

Currently only working on Linux.


PREREQUISITES
====================
- Linux OS
- JACK Audio Connection Kit (http://jackaudio.org/)
- FFTW3 fft libraries (http://www.fftw.org/)
- Some third party DAW that is compatible with JACK (Ardour works)


INSTALLATION
====================
1. Pull down the code from repository
2. Go into the Builds/Linux directory and run "make"
3. The executable MixVis should now be in Builds/Linux/build


USING THE VISUALIZER
====================
1. Start up the visualizer (./Builds/Linux/build/Mixvis). You probably have to start it from a folder containing "gammatone_filter.txt" and "cutoff_freqs.txt". 
2. Start up your third party audio application. I have been using Ardour which seems to play very nicely with Jack.
3. Make the appropriate connections via the Jack Audio Connection Kit patchbay. The outputs from your third party application should be routed to the inputs on the device "MixVisJACK". In_1 of MixVisJack corresponds to the right channel of your first track, In_2 corresponds to the left channel of the first track and so on. Currently up to FOUR stereo tracks are supported. In order to use with mono tracks, set your mono tracks to have stereo output in your third party application.
4. Play audio through your third party application and it should be visualized!

KNOWN BUGS as of 6/12/2014
====================
- Dummy masking models cause feedback (not planning on fixing this because real masking models are on the way)

LIMITATIONS
====================
- No way to save settings
- Interface not extremely pretty
